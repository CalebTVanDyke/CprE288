CprE288
=======
CprE288 is our embedded systems course.  In this course we get to work on a robot with many different sensors on it that we can use to detect our surroundings and move.
For our final project we are assigned to design the robot so that we can maneuver the robot around a course only using the sensors.
So we are not alound to actually watch the robot we can only use the data that is returned by the robot.
For this project I made a GUI using Java Swing that would recieve the data from the robot and display it in a user friendly way.
Using this data we were able to tell where the obsticals were and how to avoid them.
